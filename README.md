This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# TypeCode — Syntax Typing Trainer

## Overview

**TypeCode** is a developer-focused typing platform designed to help programmers improve coding speed, syntax accuracy, and muscle memory. Unlike traditional typing tests that use plain text, TypeCode trains users using real code snippets across multiple programming languages and difficulty levels.

This project is being built as a **major academic project** with a focus on real-time input processing, performance analytics, and scalable architecture using modern web technologies.

---

## Core Idea

Most typing platforms train general typing speed.
TypeCode trains **coding fluency**.

Users practice typing:

* real syntax
* real patterns
* real logic structures

The goal is to help developers:

* type faster
* reduce syntax mistakes
* build coding reflexes

---

## Key Features

### Syntax Training Modes

Practice snippets from multiple languages:

* JavaScript
* Python
* C++
* SQL

Each snippet is categorized by:

* language
* topic
* difficulty

---

### Difficulty System

Snippets are grouped by complexity:

| Level  | Description                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Easy   | basic statements              |
| Medium | logic expressions             |
| Hard   | nested logic / complex syntax |

---

### Real-Time Typing Engine

* character-by-character validation
* live caret tracking
* mistake highlighting
* instant feedback

---

### Smart Error Analytics

Tracks mistake patterns such as:

* brackets
* operators
* punctuation
* keywords

Generates performance insights:

* strongest syntax area
* weakest syntax area
* improvement suggestions

---

### Stats Dashboard

After each test:

* WPM
* accuracy
* error breakdown
* consistency score

---

### Pattern Practice Mode

Users can train by concept:

* loops
* recursion
* arrays
* strings
* conditionals

This doubles as DSA syntax training.

---

### Gamified Progress

* streak tracking
* daily challenge snippet
* achievement badges

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

* Next.js
* React
* Tailwind CSS
* Framer Motion

### Backend

* Next.js API routes
* MongoDB

### Data Structure Example

```json
{
  "language": "python",
  "topic": "loops",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "code": "for i in range(n):\n    print(i)"
}
```

---

## Project Goals

This project aims to demonstrate:

* real-time input processing
* frontend performance optimization
* structured backend design
* scalable data modeling
* clean UI/UX engineering

---

## Future Enhancements

* adaptive difficulty system
* multiplayer typing battles
* AI mistake prediction
* keyboard heatmap visualization
* personalized training plans

---

## Why This Project Matters

TypeCode is not just a typing test.
It is a **developer skill training platform**.

It combines:

* learning
* performance analytics
* gamification
* real coding practice
